_Think this name will be rewritte_

## What's this

This app _(will)_ basically allow users from supermarkets (Peru for now):

- Metro
- Tottus **(wip)**
- Plaza vea
- Wong
  to easily enjoy an experience similar to what's found on Amazon Go, scan a product from barcode, enter the code and delete any item if needed; then be able to pay
  for everything using any card (GPay, Apple Pay is on my priority too) and be givin a valid receipt that can be shown to security before exiting the place.

### Update

Haven't been as active as I wanted on this project mainly because I'm awaiting my macbook to finally arrive, thus being able to use the Expo IOS simulator.

_I'll be back soon_

**This app will be completely FREE, and it'll be funded a minimal 0.5% comission on every payment**
