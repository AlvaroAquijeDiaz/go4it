*Think this name will be rewritte*

## What's this

This app *(will)* basically allow users from supermarkets (Peru for now): 
  - Metro
  - Tottus **(wip)**
  - Plaza vea
  - Wong
to easily enjoy an experience similar to what's found on Amazon Go, scan a product from barcode, enter the code and delete any item if needed; then be able to pay 
for everything using any card (GPay, Apple Pay is on my priority too) and be givin a valid receipt that can be shown to security before exiting the place.

**This app will be completely FREE, and it'll be funded a minimal 0.5% comission on every payment**
